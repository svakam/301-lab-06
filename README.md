## Overview
Start a Node.js server that will act as a back-end for receiving a search query for a city. Upon the query, process the query and return data to the front-end regarding the city's location and weather. 

## Getting Started
- Deploy a server through Node.js and Express. 
- Get query and process query through a function that obtains data from .json files that contain location and weather data. 
- Return the results through a response to the front-end. 
- Test output by deploying the back-end and aplying it to the front end to see if weather and location data are being shown on the front-end.
